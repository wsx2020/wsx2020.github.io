          <h3>creating a Roblox account</h3>
        </header>
        <p> While not necessary to use Roblox Studio, it is preferable that you create a Roblox account in order for your builds and projects to be saved on the cloud, rather than locally on your computer. A roblox account is also needed in order to install Roblox Studio in the first place, so you might as well make one and enjoy all the other stuff made in the game as well. </p>

            <h4> 1. go to <a href="https://roblox.com/account/signupredir"> roblox </a> </h4>
            <p> Pretty straightforward. If you aren't logged in, using the link <a href="https://roblox.com">https://roblox.com</a> will redirect to the Roblox sign up page. </p> 
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> 2. sign up </h4>
            <p> If you don't know how to fill in a form to create your account, I don't know how you even got here. </p> 
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> 3. log in </h4>
            <p> Naturally, just get your essential details set up and proceed to the next heading. Congrats! You made a roblox account. </p>

          <h3> downloading and running Studio </h3>
        </header>
          <p> The Roblox Studio program download can be found once you attempt to edit a place/game in the Roblox Develop tab. Run the setup program as you would normally for any other installation program. You will get a prompt by Windows to allow for Studio to install. </p> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4> 1. go to the Create tab </h4>
            <p> Once logged in, the create tab is easily visible among the games and robux tab. </p> 
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> 2. Edit a place </h4>
            <p> Click the edit button to the side of the place you are editing. </p> 
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> 3. Wait for Studio to load </h4>
            <p> Depending on what is in the place and the capability of your computer, this can take seconds up to a minute. </p>

          <h3>basic navigation</h3>
        </header>
        <p> The general layout of Roblox Studio follows the same design as that of other game creation engines, although there are still some minor differences that need to be learned. Defer to <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/resources/studio/Landing-Page">this Quick Reference</a> released by Roblox.</p>

        <hr>
        <p> The primary layout can be changed to any scheme you want, but at default the general building tools are at the top. The explorer (part finder, navigation) is on the right, the script output is on the bottom, and the toolbox is on the right. </p> 
        <p> At the very top is a series of separate tabs to view, each of which offer specific tabs for things such as modeling, general part movement and resizing, and plugin management. </p> 
         <p> There are dozens of other tabs that can be removed and added at will to suit your needs. Familiarize yourself with the layout and know its ins and outs. </p>

        <p> Roblox Studio has a rudimentary block building system, mixed in with the ability to import complex 3D models through the Union system and access to the public toolbox to use free models. </p>

        <p> Here are some tutorials on how to build in Roblox Studio </p>

        <p> The three general building tools in Studio are moving, resizing, and rotating. These form the basis of your building and are the backbone of how you create your world. By using your mouse on the handles that appear, you can use these tools to their maximum potential.</p>
