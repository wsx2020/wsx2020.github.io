  The Ishango Bone is possibly the oldest mathematical artefact still in existence: it was discovered in 1950, in the Democratic Republic of Congo in central Africa, and is named after the region where it was found. It is dates back to the Upper Paleolithic period of human history, and is approximately 20,000 years old.

<p>

  The bone is 10 cm long and contains a series of notches, which many scientists believe were used for counting. The grouping of the notches might even suggest some more advanced mathematical understanding, like decimal numbers or prime numbers.</div>

</a></b><br>

  In ancient Mesopotamia, almost 10,000 years ago, scribes and merchants started using small, three-dimensional clay objects as counters, to represent certain quantities, units or goods. Thousands of these were found on archaeological sites across the Middle East, like these from Tepe Gawra in Iraq (from around 4000 BCE):

  <p>

  The cone, sphere and flat disc were used to represent small, medium and large measures of grain. The tetrahedron probably measured the amount of work done in one day.

  <p>

  These two tablets from Susa in Iran were created around 3200 BCE and used a more advanced technique: the counters were pressed into the clay while it was still soft, to create a record:

  <p>

  Again, the triangular and circular impressions represent smaller and larger measures of grain. The patterns across the rest of the tablet were the official seals of the scribes.

  This tablet shows a multiplication table that was created around 2600 BCE in the Sumerian city of Shuruppak. It is one of the oldest mathematical tablets we have ever discovered.
 <p>
  The table has three columns. The dots in the first two columns represent distances ranging from around 6 meters to 3 kilometres. The third column contains the product of the first two, which is the area of a rectangle with the given dimensions.
 <p>
  Sumer was a region of ancient Mesopotamia in the Middle East. They invented Cuneiform as one of the earliest writing systems, by pressing small, wedge-shaped markers into clay tablets like this one. They also developed the base-60 number system.

  <b><a href = "https://mathigon.org/timeline/plimpton-322">Babylonian Tablet (Plimpton 322)</a></b><br>
  This Babylonian clay tablet, called Plimpton 322, was created around 1750 BCE in Sumeria, during the reign of Hammurabi the Great.
<p>
  While more than 1000 years older than Pythagoras, the rows and columns on this table contain Pythagorean triples: integer solutions for the equation a2+b2=c2. For example, (3, 4, 5) is a Pythagorean triple because 32+42=52.
<p>
  The exact purpose of the tablet has been debated by archeologists. Some think that it was a “teachers aid”, designed to help generate right-angled triangles. Others think it may be a very early trigonometry table.

  This circular tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection, called YBC 7289, was created around 1800 – 1600 BCE in ancient Babylon. It shows the geometric diagram of a square with its diagonals.
<p>
  The cuneiform numerals indicate that one side of the square is 30 units long, and show how to find the length of the diagonal: 302+302≈42 units.
<p>
  The tablet shows that Babylonian scribes knew Pythagoras’ theorem, more than 1000 years before Pythagoras was even born. They were also able to calculate square roots and had an estimate for 2 accurate to 6 decimal places. It is the highest computational accuracy ever seen in the ancient world!
<p>
  While this simple tablet may have just been a practice exercise by a novice scribe, its mathematical and historical importance is enormous.

  The Rhind Papyrus is one of the most famous mathematical documents from ancient Egypt. It was written around 1550 BCE by a scribe called Ahmose, who is maybe the earliest contributor to maths in history, whose name we still know today.
  <p>
  The papyrus is around 2 meters long and contains 84 problems about multiplication, division, fractions, and geometry. It was probably used as a kind of “textbook” by other scribes.
  <p>
  One of the most notable sections is a 2n table. This shows how you can write rational numbers of the form 2n, where n is an odd number, as sums of unit fractions.
  <p>
  The papyrus is named after Scottish antiquarian Alexander Henry Rhind, who purchased it in Luxor, Egypt. Today, most of its remains are located at the British Museum in London.

  Pythagoras tried to explain music in a mathematical way, and discovered that two tones sound “nice” together (consonant) if the ratio of their frequencies is a simple fraction.

  He also founded a school in Italy where he and his students worshipped mathematics almost like a religion, while following a number of bizarre rules – but the school was eventually burned down by their adversaries.

But before doing that, you have to runn a quarter of the distance (25 meters). Before running a quarter, you have to run 18th,116th, and so on. This is an infinite number of tasks, which means that you’ll never arrive!

  Euclid, sometimes called Euclid of Alexandria to distinguish him from Euclides of Megara, was a Greek mathematician, often referred to as the "father of geometry". He was active in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I (323–283 BC). His Elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics (especially geometry) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century. In the Elements, Euclid deduced the principles of what is now called Euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms. Euclid also wrote works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, number theory, and rigor. <p>

    <div id="right"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05719"> <b>Efficent Evaluation of Scaled Proximal Operators</b></a><br>
    Here I discuss discussion the linear algebraic tricks used to solve proximal
    subproblems efficiently. Be forewarned, the number of times I used the
    Woodbury Matrix Identity is nearly criminal. This project led to the
    development of QSip.

    <b><a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5586">Tail Bounds for Stochastic

    My first paper in grad school. Here I investigated at the role concentration
    plays in randomized algorithms for optimization, in particular stochastic
    gradient descent. <br><br> <b>

    I saw a beautiful spindle diagram in a natural history museum in montreal
    (it looked a little like <a href =
    "https://www2.estrellamountain.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/pro_plfr.gif">this</a>
    or <a href =
    "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Spindle_diagram.jpg">this</a>)
    and I wondered if I could do something similar for memes on the
    internet. Perhaps memes obeyed similar forces, living and dying in the
    microclimates of our imagination. A long shot, perhaps. But philosophical
    pretentions aside, I enjoy at least the visual analogy. Here it is - a <a
    href="https://d3js.org/"> D3 </a> visualization of <a href =
    "http://www.pushshift.io">Jason Braughmerger's</a> meticulously mined reddit
    dataset showing all posts in /r/AdviceAnimal to Dec 2014 with over 50
    up-votes. Enjoy!

    are some deep dreams I made using code available online.
